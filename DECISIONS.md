# Architecture Decision Records

This file is the canonical ADR registry until ADR entries are split into individual files.

## ADR-001: Canonical Source Of Truth

Status: Accepted
Date: 2026-07-15

Decision:
The repository itself is the single source of truth for product architecture. No parallel private specifications are authoritative.

Context:
Project quality depends on one canonical definition per concept and zero ambiguity about which document governs.

Consequences:

- all architecture updates must be committed in this repository
- duplicate definitions must be consolidated or removed
- references must point to canonical documents

## ADR-002: Documentation-First Delivery

Status: Accepted
Date: 2026-07-15

Decision:
No implementation is started until architecture specifications are complete for all required domains.

Context:
Rework risk is highest when implementation precedes architecture.

Consequences:

- roadmap prioritizes manual completion over prototyping
- implementation tasks depend on architecture acceptance criteria

## ADR-003: Product Category And Positioning

Status: Accepted
Date: 2026-07-15

Decision:
Project F1 is positioned as a Discoverability Intelligence Platform, not a generic SEO audit tool.

Context:
The product must unify traditional search discoverability and AI answer discoverability in one operating model.

Consequences:

- messaging, product scope and capability design center on discoverability outcomes
- score model includes both search and AI discoverability dimensions

## ADR-004: Non-Invasive Remediation Model

Status: Accepted
Date: 2026-07-15

Decision:
The platform generates implementation-ready remediation artifacts but does not directly modify customer production systems.

Context:
Direct write access increases security and liability burden and slows enterprise trust.

Consequences:

- platform outputs patches, prompts, snippets and task guides
- no automatic direct deployment in early architecture scope

## ADR-005: Initial Target Architecture Stack

Status: Accepted
Date: 2026-07-15

Decision:
Primary implementation target remains Rails 8 with PostgreSQL, Hotwire, Tailwind, Redis and Sidekiq.

Context:
The constitution already establishes this stack and it aligns with team execution constraints.

Consequences:

- downstream architecture documents optimize for this stack
- deviations require explicit ADR updates

## ADR-006: Immutable Foundation Layer

Status: Accepted
Date: 2026-07-15

Decision:
Documents `specification/000` through `specification/020` are established as the immutable foundation layer of the Product Architecture Manual.

Context:
Later volumes require stable, shared definitions and principles to avoid drift and contradictory architecture.

Consequences:

- all subsequent chapters must reference foundation documents instead of redefining core concepts
- changes to foundation documents require ADR updates and dependent chapter updates in the same pass
- foundation documents govern terminology, principles, decision process and documentation standards

## ADR-007: Sequencing Gate For Later Volumes

Status: Accepted
Date: 2026-07-15

Decision:
Product, UX, Database and API specifications beyond current Volume I scope are blocked until Volume I acceptance criteria are met.

Context:
Foundational architecture must be coherent and accepted before deeper domain specialization to avoid structural rework.

Consequences:

- roadmap milestones include explicit start gates for later volumes
- project state tracks gate compliance as an active control
- any exception requires explicit ADR with rationale and risk plan

## ADR-008: Foundation Dependency Model

Status: Accepted
Date: 2026-07-15

Decision:
The canonical dependency model is established from foundation layer 000-020 through implementation, and upstream constitutional documents MUST NOT silently depend on downstream implementation choices.

Context:
Dependency ambiguity creates contradictory specifications and rework.

Consequences:

- dependency graph is mandatory in manual control documents
- downstream layers MAY depend on upstream layers only
- sequencing gates are enforced through roadmap and review controls

## ADR-009: Test-Driven Development Policy

Status: Accepted
Date: 2026-07-15

Decision:
TDD is the default implementation discipline, with failing-test-first behavior required for production changes.

Context:
Behavior-first verification is required to preserve correctness and prevent regression drift.

Consequences:

- engineering principles include mandatory Red, Green, Refactor policy
- defect fixes require reproducing failing tests before code changes
- merge gates require passing test suite with exception governance for rare cases

## ADR-010: Documentation-As-Code Policy

Status: Accepted
Date: 2026-07-15

Decision:
Documentation is treated as governed system artifact with deterministic generation and mandatory traceability.

Context:
Separate narrative and implementation truths create operational and governance failure.

Consequences:

- documentation standards include mandatory documentation-as-code rules
- documentation drift is treated as build or review failure
- generated documentation is source-controlled through canonical generators

## ADR-011: Architecture Fitness-Function Policy

Status: Accepted
Date: 2026-07-15

Decision:
Architecture principles are enforced through a canonical fitness-function catalog with owners, gates, and exception process.

Context:
Unmeasured principles degrade over time and fail to protect architecture boundaries.

Consequences:

- fitness functions become release-governing controls
- unresolved numeric thresholds use provisional gates with deadlines
- exception handling requires bounded ADR-backed governance

## ADR-012: Foundation Baseline Version 1.0 And Controlled Change

Status: Accepted
Date: 2026-07-15

Decision:
Foundation 000-020 is declared baseline version 1.0 and immutable except through controlled change.

Context:
Foundational stability is required before downstream domain elaboration.

Consequences:

- normative foundation changes require ADR and impact mapping
- downstream affected specifications, tests, diagrams, schemas, and contracts must be identified
- compatibility and migration assessments are mandatory when applicable

## ADR-013: Canonical Diagram Authority Model

Status: Accepted
Date: 2026-07-15

Decision:
Each required architecture view has one canonical source diagram file in `diagrams/`, linked by foundation documents.

Context:
Conflicting diagram sources undermine architecture consistency.

Consequences:

- one authoritative source exists for each required architecture view
- duplicate boundary diagrams are prohibited
- diagram updates require linked specification updates in same change set
